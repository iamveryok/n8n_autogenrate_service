# Building Complex Workflows with Claude

This guide demonstrates how to create advanced n8n workflows using Claude AI and the MCP n8n Workflow Builder.

## Multi-Node Data Processing Workflow

Here's an example of creating a workflow that fetches data from an API, processes it, and sends notifications based on conditions:

```
Create an n8n workflow called "Customer Data Processor" with these steps:
1. Trigger on a schedule every day at 8 AM
2. Fetch customer data from https://api.example.com/customers
3. Filter out inactive customers
4. For each active customer:
   a. Check their subscription status
   b. If subscription is expiring within 7 days, send an email reminder
   c. If subscription has special requirements, add to a separate list
5. Save the processed data to a Google Sheet
6. Send a summary report to the team
```

Claude will break this down and help you implement it using the appropriate n8n nodes.

## Branching Workflow with Error Handling

This example shows how to create a workflow with conditional paths and error handling:

```
Build a workflow called "Order Processor" that does the following:
1. Start with an HTTP webhook that receives order data
2. Validate the order data structure
3. If invalid, return an error response
4. If valid, branch into three paths:
   a. For orders under $100, process automatically
   b. For orders $100-$1000, add to review queue
   c. For orders over $1000, trigger manager approval
5. Each path should have proper error handling
6. When an order completes processing on any path, send a confirmation
7. Log all activities to a database
```

Claude will help you structure this complex workflow with proper branches and error handling.

## Integration with Multiple External Services

This example demonstrates connecting multiple services:

```
Create a workflow called "Content Publishing Pipeline" that:
1. Monitors a Dropbox folder for new documents
2. When a new document is found, extract its content and metadata
3. Check the content with an AI text classifier
4. Based on the classification:
   a. Format it appropriately
   b. Create an image using DALL-E or another image generation API
   c. Schedule it for posting to the right platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
5. Update the content calendar in Notion
6. Notify the team on Slack when the content is published
```

Claude will help you build this integration workflow connecting various external services.

## Data Transformation with Advanced Logic

This example shows complex data manipulation:

```
Create a workflow called "Financial Report Generator" that:
1. Pulls transaction data from a database
2. Groups transactions by category, department, and time period
3. Calculates key metrics:
   a. Total spend by category
   b. Month-over-month changes
   c. Budget variance
   d. Forecasted expenses
4. Generates different report formats:
   a. Executive summary (PDF)
   b. Detailed spreadsheet (Excel)
   c. Interactive dashboard data (JSON)
5. Distributes reports to appropriate stakeholders
6. Archives raw data and reports for compliance
```

Claude will guide you through setting up the logic and transformations needed for this complex reporting workflow.

## Tips for Working with Complex Workflows

When building advanced workflows with Claude:

1. **Start with a clear outline**: List the major steps and decision points before building.

2. **Use prompts as building blocks**: Start with prompts for common patterns, then extend them.

3. **Build incrementally**: Create and test sections of your workflow before combining them.

4. **Add error handling early**: Include error paths from the beginning rather than as an afterthought.

5. **Test with sample data**: Provide Claude with examples of the data your workflow will process.

6. **Consider modularity**: Break very complex processes into multiple workflows that can call each other.

7. **Document your workflow**: Ask Claude to document the workflow it creates for future reference.

## Debugging Complex Workflows

For workflows that aren't functioning correctly, you can ask Claude for help:

```
My "Order Processor" workflow isn't correctly handling orders over $1000. Here's the workflow ID: abc123. What might be wrong?
```

Claude can analyze the workflow structure and suggest improvements or fixes.
